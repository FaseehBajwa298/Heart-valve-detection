## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Local web server (optional, for development)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-heart-valve-detection.git
   cd ai-heart-valve-detection
   ```

2. **Open the application**
   - **Option 1**: Open `index.html` directly in your browser
   - **Option 2**: Use a local server (recommended)
     ```bash
     # Using Python
     python -m http.server 8000
     
     # Using Node.js
     npx serve .
     
     # Using PHP
     php -S localhost:8000
     ```

3. **Access the application**
   - Direct: `file:///path/to/index.html`
   - Local server: `http://localhost:8000`
